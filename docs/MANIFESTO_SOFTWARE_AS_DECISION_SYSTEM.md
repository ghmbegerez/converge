# Manifesto: Software Engineering as a Decision System

## 1. Fundamental Declaration

A software system is not code.
It is the structured accumulation of technical decisions over time.

Every line represents a decision.
Every decision alters the future space of possibilities.
Every change has systemic consequences.

Software engineering is the discipline that governs those decisions.

---

## 2. Fundamental Principles

### 2.1 The system is accumulated history

The current state of the system is the result of:
- Explicit decisions
- Implicit decisions
- Omissions
- Refactorings
- Corrections

Code is evidence.
Architecture is consequence.

---

### 2.2 Every decision has deferred cost

Decisions must be evaluated across three horizons:

- Short term: velocity
- Medium term: maintainability
- Long term: evolutionary capacity

A correct decision today can become a blocker tomorrow.

---

### 2.3 Change = Transformation of the future space

Every change:

- Opens paths
- Closes paths
- Introduces entropy
- Modifies systemic risk

The goal is not only to solve the current problem.
It is to preserve the system's future capacity.

---

### 2.4 Entropy is inevitable

Every change introduces disorder.

Entropy:
- Accumulates
- Propagates
- Does not disappear on its own

It must be actively managed.

---

### 2.5 Refactoring is strategic discipline

Refactoring is not cosmetic improvement.
It is deliberate reduction of structural entropy.

Refactoring is restoring decisional coherence.

---

### 2.6 Stable internal contracts

Sustainable evolution requires real modularization:
- External API over internal API
- Services with bounded responsibilities
- Explicit interfaces between layers

Without stable internal contracts,
every local change increases global coupling.

---

## 3. Decisional Governance

A healthy system must always be able to answer:

- What decision was made?
- Why was it made?
- What alternatives were discarded?
- What consequences did it have?
- What impact did it generate?

Without traceability there is no engineering.
Only accumulation.

---

## 4. Principle of Total Intentionality

Nothing should exist in the system without explicit intent.

Every module, pattern, or dependency must justify:

- Its purpose
- Its impact
- Its evolutionary cost

The absence of intent is the root of entropy.

---

## 5. Final Declaration

Mature engineering does not build code.
It builds sustainable decisional structures.

The system must not only be functional.
It must be evolutionarily healthy.

---

## 6. Enterprise operation as a design discipline

System quality is also defined in production:
- Explicit SLOs/SLAs
- Resilience against partial failures
- Verifiable security
- Scalability under real load

Without operational discipline,
correct architecture is not enough to sustain the system over time.
